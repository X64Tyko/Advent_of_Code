This one was a blast, the simple solution seems pretty obvious, the one implemented in main.cpp. but clearly this is far too slow as the total number of stones skyrockets. It was a lot of fun to reason through storing only each specific stone and the number of them currently in our array of stones (implemented in p2.cpp).
