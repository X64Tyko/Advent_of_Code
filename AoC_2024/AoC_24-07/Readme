Considerations:
Could have changed testOperations to take in strings instead. but figured that since it was already written for using ints and ull I would leave it as such. changing it would also result in a lot more stoi calls in the long run.

This does not gracefully handle situations where the data isn't formatted correctly, such as a testVal with no operation values.
